# Pipex

Pipex is a project designed to simulate piping in a Unix shell environment. It enables the user to chain commands using pipes, redirecting output from one command as input to the next. The project mimics the behavior of shell piping and input/output redirection, providing an essential understanding of process management and file descriptor manipulation in Unix-like systems.

## Features

- **Pipe Simulation**: Pipex allows users to chain multiple commands, passing the output of one command as input to the next.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: The project also supports redirection of input and output to/from files.
- **Process Management**: It simulates how processes are created and managed in a Unix environment.
- **Error Handling**: Pipex ensures proper error handling for common issues like invalid commands or missing files.
